    "2. Whenever you enter a new session. Don't forget to run all the cells above the cell you want to edit. If you don't do show, you will get a lot of error messages saying that some variable you are trying to use has not been defined. To run all cells above go to Cell>>Run all below\n",

    "        ii) If your kernel keeps dying that probably means that either you internet connection is failing or you are asking python to perform an unreasonably large amount of computation. In this case review your work carefully.\n",
    "4. If your Kernel dies, then go to Kernel>>Restart and then run all the cells above the cell you are at.\n",
    "5. It is good practice to always save your work as you are going over an assignment. Just do `<Command> + S` to save or go to File>>Save and Checkpoint\n",

In Python and other programming languages, there are two kinds of functions; those that already exist and are preloaded in the language (built-in funtions) and the ones the user can has written by himself (user-defined functions).

We talked about built-in functions and briefly mentioned user-defined functions, however there are also functions that other people wrote and which are made available through packages such as numpy, math or others. In order to use those, we have to refer to them not just by their name but also by their package. So you can use a package function with `<package_name>.<function_name>` after you do `import <package_name>` or, alternativey you can directly import that function from the package and refer to it by its name. For example, I can do `from <package_name> import <function_name>` and then call the function directly with `<function_name>`."
