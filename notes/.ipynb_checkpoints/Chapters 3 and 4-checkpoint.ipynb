    "A `function` in programming is a procedure that takes in some input (usually refered to as argument) and returns some result from processing whatever that input was. In Python and other programming languages, there are two kinds of functions; those that already exist and are preloaded in the language (built-in funtions) and the ones the user can has written by himself (user-defined functions). We will take a look at some useful built-in functions and later on in the course we will learn to write our own. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Packages_\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on we will be working quite a bit with what we will refer to as packages. The `datascience` or the `numpy` packages are just two examples of packages that you will be using extensively in this class. You can think of those as collections of `functions`, collections of code that given some input, allow you to automatically perform some operation. In the beginning of every notebook you will typically find a cell consisting of code that looks like this\n",
    "\n",
    "`import numpy as np`\n",
    "\n",
    "`from datascience import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`\n",
    "\n",
    "`import math`\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you don't really need to know how these statements work, it is good to have an understanding of why they are there. We talked about built-in functions and briefly mentioned user-defined functions, however there are also functions that other people wrote and which are made available through packages such as numpy, math or others. In order to use those, we have to refer to them not just by their name but also by their package. So you can use a package function with `<package_name>.<function_name>` after you do `import <package_name>` or, alternativey you can directly import that function from the package and refer to it by its name. For example, I can do `from <package_name> import <function_name>` and then call the function directly with `<function_name>`."
